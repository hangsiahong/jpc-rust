# Scaling Challenges & Solutions

## 1. Service Discovery

**Problem**: Hard-coded ports become unmanageable with many services
**Solution**: Add service registry

## 2. Data Consistency

**Problem**: Each service has its own database
**Solution**:

- Use persistent databases (PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Implement distributed transactions if needed
- Event-driven architecture for data sync

## 3. Configuration Management

**Problem**: Managing config across services
**Solution**: Centralized config service or environment variables

## 4. Monitoring & Observability

**Problem**: Hard to debug issues across services
**Solution**:

- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)

## 5. Inter-Service Communication

**Problem**: Services might need to talk to each other
**Solution**:

- Message queues (Redis, RabbitMQ)
- Event buses
- Service mesh (Istio)

## 6. Security

**Problem**: Authentication/authorization across services
**Solution**:

- JWT tokens
- OAuth2/OIDC
- API Gateway with auth middleware
